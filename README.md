# Notepad
A simple notepad app :)

## Features
- Open file
- Save file 
- Create file 
- Switch between light and dark theme

> Thats all for now. I might add more updates on later versions

## How to use it
Since its in source code means it is not yet built. So to run this app you need to have `Node.js` installed.

After that follow this step:
`npm install` then `npm update` 

When done installing dependecies and updating them, do `npm start` to run the app with **`electron.js`**
